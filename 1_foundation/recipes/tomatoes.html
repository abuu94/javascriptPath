    <h2> Tomatoes Recipes</h2>
    <p>The tomato fruit is globular or ovoid. Botanically, the fruit exhibits all of the common characteristics of
        berries; a simple fleshy fruit that encloses its seed in the pulp.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Folate.</li>
        <li>Vitamin C.</li>
        <li>Potassium.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Boil the tomatoes for 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
        <li>Watch carefully as smaller tomatoes will need less time.</li>
        <li>You don't want the tomatoes to start cooking.</li>
        <li> You'll know the tomatoes are ready to be removed when the flesh starts to wrinkle, and the skin starts to
            peel away from the flesh.</li>
    </ol>
